Welcome! This is a showcase of my firstperson/thirdperson hybrid character controller asset for Unity. This asset will be availbe on the Unity Asset Store for everyone to use in any desired project.

#
## Features
### Realistic movement 
+ Adaptive natural looking movement **generated on the fly procedurally**. ' Possesst ' utilizes  procedural  full-body animation & multiple **inverse kinematics (IK)** techniques.

#
### Use any animation you desire 
+ Customize the animations in ' pose mode ' via Unity **Aniamtion Editor** or export the viewmodel to your desired 3D modelling software for in-depth animating.

#
### All you need is your character model 
+ Automatically **generate viewmodel arms/rig instantly**! Simply drag & drop any rigged humaoid character model, and your viewmodel is automatically created.

#
### Preserves stunning realistic visuals
+ View-model without using multiple cameras while still allowing ZERO clipping of the arms. Using a special technique, the view-model casts & receives true shadows from the ENTIRE scene/world.

#
### Create any type of character controller 
+ Full-support for an **unlimited amount of character controller types** from 3D, 2D, firstperson, thirdperson, top-down, combat/fighter, etc. Endless possiblities...

#  
### Fully modular & customizable 
+ Designed to fit the needs of a more simplified approach, but has capabilites of configuring every single parameter. You can even **write your own character controller** using the 'Possesst backend library'.
